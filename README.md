#Description This is a full stack application that runs a simple film query where you are able to search through a database of films. The application has functionality to modify films, add new films, and delete films you have added to the database.
This project was an extention of the Film Query Application we made last week.
#Lessons Learned
Dave -
*One of our biggest issues was mapping the MVC. I feel like one of the easier solutions to this would be to create a UML style drawing or use a whiteboard.
*One of my personal issues, is that my files on the local machine were really messed up. I spent roughly 12 hours on Saturday and another 4 on Sunday trying to get my project back to “normal”. Because of this situation, I couldn’t help my partner other by changing files on my machine, I could only help him by telling him what to type via Zoom/Discord. We often had to use the Zoom remote control feature. I recovered my project back to “normal” using the following commands in the terminal.
git stash git log --oneline git checkout ####### <----where this is the number of your most recent commit git checkout main git pull
However, after doing this my build.gradle file would not work but at least all my files looked the same.
*Using the TA hours on Saturday, we got a road map to the solution from Luke. This was just a variation of everything we learned in the US States lab.
*On Saturday, Brandon and I watched the replay of the Zoom replay of the States Lab and started setting up our project.
*We used a lot of googling/youtube
*I spent a lot more time on this project than anticipated. Mostly because of problems with the my local machine.


Brandon - *The mapping and setup were uniquely challenging for this project *Partners are extremely helpful *Github doesn't always work on the weekends
